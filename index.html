    <h1>Scrambled Eggs</h1>
    <p>Eggs are one of my favorite foods. Here is a
      recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <1i>2 eggs</1i>
        <1i>2tbs butter</1i>
        <1i>2tbs cream</1i>
        </u1>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <o1>
          <1i>Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium
            heat</1i>
            <1i>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl</1i>
            <1i>Once butter has melted add cream and eggs</1i>
            the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if
            you are making and omelette)</1i>
            <1i>When the eggs are still moist remove from the
              heat (it will continue to cook on the plate
              until served)</1i>
